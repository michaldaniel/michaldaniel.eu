# My home office

I try to do all my real work from the office 🏢 but my home space 🏘 is super important too. It's where I work on my hobby projects 🔧, learn 📚, game 🎮, draw ✏️ and browse the web 🌐.

## The PC

The current build is:

* **CPU:** [Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4460 @ 3.20GHz][8]
* **GPU:** [NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960][9]
* **Memory:** 16GB
* **Drive:** 4x [512GB Adata SU900 SSD][10]
* **Board:** [ASUSTek H81M-PLUS][11]
* **Chassis:** Sticker-bombed some garbage chassis

I had this PC 🖥 for quite a while now and I'm really bad at planning upgrades so I just switched from a 2TB HDD to the four 512GB SSDs and upgraded the RAM sticks 🤷️.

## Monitor

I'm currently using a single [Dell UltraSharp U2414H 24" display][12] 🖥️. I was used to a dual monitor setup but after moving I had to downgrade to a smaller desk 😫️ and one of the screens had to go 😢️. In my workflow I'm relying hard on the virtual desktops.

## Input

### Keyboard

I bought two [Hykker X Range mechanical keyboards][13] ⌨️ in a different colors 🎨️, they were super cheap 🤑️ and came with the imitation of [Cherry MX Blue switches][14] that I love the sound of. At the office I have upgraded the key-caps to the [Cool Jazz white-blue mix][15], now I'm looking for something cool 😎️ to put on my home keyboard.

### Mouse

I'm using a [Steelseries Rival 110 gray gaming mouse][16] 🖱️. It's quite elegant and simple for this type of a device 👍️.

### Tablet

I have an ancient [Genius EasyPen F610E tablet][17] that I use for drawing and photo editing 🙂️. It's not the greatest device but with the current [Wacom][18] prices 💸️ I don't think about upgrading anytime soon 🤷️.

### Controller

When friends come over we play on two [Logitech F710 Wireless Game-pads][19] 🎮, they work great with Linux 🐧️👌️ and are very comfortable to hold. I'm supper happy with them.

## Audio

My speakers are the [Logitech Z-323 2.1 system][20], they work nicely enough 😑️. My headphones are the [Corsair HS50][21] 🎧️ and I love them, both the build quality and the sound are amazing 😍️.

For audio input I have a [Superlux E205U diaphragm microphone][22] 🎙️ on a suspension stand. 

## Other fluff

Apart from the obligatory cup of coffee ☕️ I also keep on my desk the [Olympus OM-D E-M10 mark II camera][23] 📷️ with the [Olympus M.Zuiko Digital f/1.8 14-42mm lens][24] that I used to take the pictures for this site. There's also an [eGo AIO e-cigarette][25] from [Joyetech][26] that I recommend to anyone trying to give up or limit smoking 🚭️, some cables, a trusty companion in the form of a [Peperomia][27] plant 🌱️, and a scented candle 🕯️ for setting up a focused, creative mood 😋️.

# On the go

![Photo of me holding my laptop][5]

## My laptop

I got myself a [Vizio CT14-A1 Thin+Light laptop][28] 💻️ for a ridiculously cheap 🤑️, it works great for taking notes, browsing web, answering emails, and sort of manages running the Android Studio 🙄️.

## Other tech

When I have my laptop I also usually carry with me a [Logitech Ultra-Thin T630 touch mouse][29] 🖱️ and a [Xiaomi's Mi Pro HD earphones][30] 🎧️.

# My office

At the actual office 🏢 I have a two monitor setup, the same [Hykker mechanical keyboard][13] ⌨️ I use at home,  workstation is a Dell Optiplex 9020 with a few upgrades (RAM & Memory) and I have my own [Superlux HD-681EVO headphones][32] 🎧️.

My desk is usually cluttered with a ridiculous amount of plants 🌿️, notes 📔️, pots and mugs of different hot beverages 🍵️ and there is also [a rat][33] 🐭️ and [a duck][34] 🦆️ 😝️.

I also sticker-bomb everything wherever I am and go.
