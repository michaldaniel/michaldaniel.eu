![My clean desktop][1]
[Grab the wallpaper.][2]

# The operating system

I am using [Ubuntu GNU/Linux][17] 🐧️ with [GNOME desktop][18], since they made that default I just switch to pure GNOME session 👍.

![My dirty desktop][3]

# Mods and themes

I use [my own GTK theme][19], that's a blend of [Arc][20] and [Deepin][21] themes, and I use [Flat Remix][22] icons 😎. Styling of terminal is handled by [wal][23], a script to generate color configurations 🎨️ based on your wallpaper 😙.

Across my OS I use [Noto font family][24], Noto Sans for desktop apps and Noto Mono for editors and terminal.

# [GNOME][18]

I love [GNOME][18] 😍 and big part of that is ability to customize it with [extensions][25]. The ones I'm using now: [Appindicator support][26], [Caffeine][27], [Dash to dock][28], and [Workspaces to dock][29].

# Software

![Android studio][6]

## [Android Studio][30]

[Android Studio][30] is my main weapon in the tool belt 🔧. I customize it with a few useful plugins like better support for [.gitignore][31] or [rainbow brackets][32] 🌈.

Oh, and I'm the guy that likes light themes. Come at me with your pitchforks 🔥 but they are just easier on my eyes 😝.

![Builder][7]

## [Builder][33]

[Builder][33] is the new IDE from [GNOME][18] and is awesome 👌 for working on desktop apps in [Vala][34] or [Python][35]. It's fast, it's good and improving constantly 👍.

![gedit][8]

## [Text editor][36]

My text editor 📝 of choice is [gedit][36], with combination of powerful plugins (too many to mention) it's future rich and pretty fast 😃. I use it to work with [web stuff][37], [scripts][38] and [configs][39]. 

![gitg][9]

## [gitg][40]

I like [gitg][40] for working with [git][41], it is small, has a nice tree 🌳️ view and some basic capabilities. For complicated git stuff I always end up working with terminal anyway 🤷️.

![Tilix][10]

## [Tilix][42]

[Tilix][42] can do panes, tabs, drag and drop and is just overall the best terminal emulator 🔥. Combine it with the power of [oh-my-zsh][43], my favorite [eastwood theme][44] and [bunch of plugins][45] it's THE TOOL 🔧 to get stuff done 😍.

![Bookworm][11]

## [Bookworm][46]

The best eBook reader 👌 and that comes from someone who spend a lot of sweat and blood [developing his own][47] 😑.

![Holy trinity][12]

## [Mail][48], [Calendar][49] & [Todo][50]

GNOME [Mail][48], [Calendar][49] and [Todo][50] is my holy trinity 👼 of staying organized.

![UberWriter][13]

## [UberWriter][51]

[UberWriter][51] is ma favorite markdown editor, I use it to view and edit my notes 📔 and general writing ✏️.

![Firefox][14]

## [Firefox][52]

[Mozilla][53] has done a lot for open source and free web 🙂 and they even made a [good browser][52]. You just can't say no to the cute fox 🦊.

![Gimp][15]

## [GIMP][54]

[GIMP][54] is older than the universe but it has seen some active development recently 😮 and remains my go to image editor.

![LibreOffice][16]

## [LibreOffice][55]

Old school offline office suite to cover all your officy 😗 needs, it got me though school 🎒, university 🏫, and does a good job at work 🏢.

## Honorable mentions 

- [Gravit designer][56] - pretty cool mock-up and vector design tool
- [Teleport][57] - for sharing stuff over WiFi
- [Sequeler][58] - for browsing online and local SQL databases
- [Spice-Up][59] - for throwing together quick and nice presentations
- [Paperwork][60] - for keeping my businesses documentation organized
- [Image Optimizer][61] - lossless image optimization for the web
- [Podcasts][62] - GNOME's new podcasts app looks sweet 😍

There is obviously a lot more to list but there is always more. 🤷️
