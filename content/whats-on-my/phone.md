![My Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 device][2]

# My device

My current device is the [Xiaomi Redmi Note 5][1], a pretty cool 😎 (in my humble opinion) budget Chinese phone 📱. It offers a great value for money 💸 and has a good battery life 🔋.

## Case for the budget phones

In my experience budget phones have been getting closer and closer to the industry flagships 🚢. They can't offer the same quality and refinement as flagship phones but you can get a pretty sweet package 📦 for a fraction of the price, while upgradeing more often and worrying less about breaking stuff 👌.

## MIUI Android is kind of cool

Since MIUI Global 10+ and EU's GDPR legislation Xiaomi's default apps don't ask for weird permissions 😨 and network monitoring shows clean slate of outgoing traffic 🕵️ clearing my worries about using Chinese ROM.

What is left is a pretty decent OS with Android Oreo 🍪 as a base, recent security updates, and a nice design. The single app grid, quick search, and left side widget screen make for a good experience 😍, it's like a cross between stock Android 🤖 and Apple 🍎 device. I grew to like the default apps too 👍.

# Cloud

I try to sync as much stuff as possible with my [Nextcloud][5] 📡 server, so I use DAV protocol to sync contacts, calendars and tasks, and a special [notes client][6] 📔 that can talk with it.
