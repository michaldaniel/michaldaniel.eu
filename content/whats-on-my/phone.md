# My device

My current device is Xiaomi Redmi Note 5, pretty cool (in my humble opinion) budget Chinese phone. It offers great value for money and has pretty good battery life.

## Case for budget phones

Redmi Note 5 is my third budget phone, I can afford more than I used to and yet I keep buying those low-end devices. In my experience budget phones has been getting closer and closer to the industry flagships. They can't offer the same quality and refinement as flagship phones but you can get a pretty sweet package for the fraction of the price, can upgrade more often and worry less about breaking stuff. 

## MIUI is kind of coolâ€¦

I used to hate MIUI, the first things I would do to a Xiaomi device is to install LineageOS on it. But that changed with MIUI Global 10+. Since the official EU release and EU's GDPR legislation default apps don't ask for wird permissions and network monitoring shows clean slate of outgoing traffic.

What is left is a pretty decent ROM with Android Oreo as a base, recent security updates and with a nice design, single grid experience, quick search and left side widget screen. I grew to like it a lot.
