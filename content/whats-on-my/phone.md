# My device

My current device is the [Xiaomi Redmi Note 5](https://www.mi.com/global/redmi-note-5/), a pretty cool 😎 (in my humble opinion) budget Chinese phone 📱. It offers a great value for the money 💸 and has a good battery life 🔋.

## Case for the budget phones

In my experience budget phones has been getting closer and closer to the industry flagships. They can't offer the same quality and refinement as flagship phones but you can get a pretty sweet package 📦 for the fraction of the price, can upgrade more often and worry less about breaking stuff 👌. 

## MIUI Android is kind of cool

Since MIUI Global 10+ and EU's GDPR legislation Xiaomi's default apps don't ask for wird permissions 😨 and network monitoring shows clean slate of outgoing traffic 🕵️ clearing my worries about using Chinese ROM.

What is left is a pretty decent OS with Android Oreo 🍪 as a base, recent security updates, and a nice design. The single app grid, quick search, and left side widget screen make for a good experience 😍, it's like a cross between stock Android 🤖 and Apple 🍎 device. I grew to like the default apps too 👍.

# My apps

## Standard

Like on everybody's phones you will find on mine social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, Peach, Mastalab, and Linkedin. Bunch of communication tools - Messenger Lite (because Messenger), Telegram, Signal, Slack, media apps - Spotify, Twitch, Steam, Audible, YouTube, and other for shopping, banking, Google Maps, Jakdojade and Uber for moveing around, Google News,
